<h3>BEAST Studio history</h3>

<p>Any text entered in the console is stored as history. Using the filter
option, this makes it easy to find back fragments of scripts already tried
in the past.</p>

<p>Selecting part of the history, and selecting the 'To console' button
in the button box, pastes the selection in the console.</p>

<p>To clear the history, use the 'Remove' button in the toolbar.</p>

<p>When entering text in the filter entry, only lines in the history
matching the text will be displayed. Use the 'clear' button to stop
filtering.</p>
