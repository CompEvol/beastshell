BEASTShell is based on <a href='http://code.google.com/p/beanshell2'>BeanShell 2.2</a>
which is based on <a href='http://www.beanshell.org'>BeanShell</a>.
Many people have contributed substantially to BeansShell
and thus BEASTShell over the years. Pat Niemeyer (pat@pat.net) is the inventor of Beanshell 
and graciously made it an open source project to build on. Thanks to Daniel Leuck for his 
long time support and many contributions to the project.</p>
