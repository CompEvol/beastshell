<h2>
		Why is it called "BEASTShell"?
		</h2>
</a>
		BEASTShell is based on BeanShell, which got it's name 
		partially as a pun on "bash" (the GNU "Bourne again" shell)
		"bash"-&gt;"bsh" and then there's the obvious beans reference.
		<br/>
		BEASTShell is an adaption of BeanShell for easily creating 
		BEASTObjects, so the name seemed appropriate.

<h2>
		How does BEASTShell relate to other Java scripting languages like
		JavaScript, Jacl, and JPython.
		</h2>
</a>
		JavaScript is evolving, but fragile and gross - not unlike, I'd imagine,
		the first slimy creatures to crawl out of the oceans billions of years
		ago. JavaScript's history has had little to do with Java and I am
		therefore highly skeptical about it. 
		<br/>
		I was, on the other hand, very excited about Sun's announcement that
		they intended to port Tcl to Java (Jacl) and provide greater Tcl/Java
		integration. Tcl is cool and my desire for an embeddable / extensible
		scripting language for Java drove me to start this project. However I
		have not seen much progress on this project since John Ousterhout left
		Sun. 
		<br/>
		JPython is a port of the Python language to Java. I like Python as a
		more object oriented and structured / regular alternative to Perl. 
		(Although the use of formatting for code blocking offends my C
		sensibilities ;) ). Python may be the best choice for a full blown
		scripting language. However it is signifigantly heavier than BEASTShell
		for use as a scripting extension language and it does require that
		programmers learn yet another language (albeit a good one). 
		<br/>
		It is entirely possible that one or more of these languages will
		eventually supercede the role of BEASTShell. However their full
		implementations will undoubtedly be quite large (many megs) and there
		will probably always be a role for a light weight, "obvious" and simple
		scripting extension language. The goal then is to keep the core of bsh
		as small as possible. The core of BEASTShell is currently about 135K and
		may actually get smaller in the future.

<h2>
		What tools were used to create BEASTShell?
		</h2>
</a>
		Beanshell is based on the Sun Java 1.1 grammar and the parser is
		generated using <a href="http://www.metamata.com">JavaCC</a> (Sun's YACC
		for Java). There are some bsh extensions to the Java grammar and some
		subtractions of course. The bsh grammar and supporting code are supplied
		in the source release. You may marvel at its beauty or retreat in horror
		at its ugliness depending on where you look ;)
		<br/>
		I took some liberties with the Java grammar and
		"unrolled" some constructs to make it easier to deal with early on.
		Some of these decisions were probably mistakes but some may actually
		make bsh slightly more efficient. A future rewrite may clean up the
		grammar.

<h2>
		Does BEASTShell reparse scripted methods on each invocation?
		</h2>
</a>
		No.  Scripted methods are parsed once and stored in a parse tree.
		Reparsing can be forced by calling the source command.  
		<hr/>

<h2>
		Why does BEASTShell encounter problems during deserialization of
		primitive type (class) identifiers? / Why do I get a
		java.lang.ClassNotFoundException during deserialization?
		</h2>
</a>
		This problem is due to a known bug occurring in JDK/JRE 1.3.1 and below.
		The numeric primitive types class identifiers (e.g. Integer.TYPE) aren't
		properly deserialized by ObjectInputStream.  Attempting to do so will
		cause a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException When using JDK 1.3.1 or lower
		you can employ a workaround by subclassing ObjectInputStream.  The
		workaround is described in detail
		<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4171142.html">
		here.</a>

<h2>
		Why is bsh slower executing the first few commands?
		</h2>
</a>
		The BEASTShell parser uses a lot of small classes to build the parse
		tree. Java may not load (and verify) a given classes until you happen to
		exercise the corresponding part of the Java grammar. (For example, it
		may not load the class bsh.ASTForStatement until you use a "for" loop.)
		You may notice this as a slight slow down on the first couple of
		commands you execute. 
		<br/>
		To ameliorate the situation, as its first action, bsh prints its banner
		message using its own bsh "eval" command... This gets things moving a
		bit. 
		<hr/>

<h2>
		Why is BEASTShell so slow when executing certain operations such as for
		loops?
		</h2>
</a>
		As with any scripting language, BEASTShell trades performance for
		flexibility.  Certain operations are slower than others.  For loops, for
		example, are noticeably slower than Java because the primitives involved
		are being coerced to objects.  Object creation is computationally
		expensive.  BEASTShell will continue to be optimized but will always
		remain slower than Java.
		<hr/>	

	<a name="12">
<h2>
		How does bsh deal with multi-line statements on the command line?
		</h2>
</a>
		BEASTShell is not very friendly as a shell. (Although the bsh console
		window implements a simple history for you. The raw parser does not
		provide any feedback on a statement by statement basis. The happy little
		"bsh" prompt is generated in the main interpreter loop and a little more
		happens before your characters ever get to the interpreter. 
		<br/>
		Normally, the parser would insist on detecting a trailing ";" before it
		would complete a line. In order to provide the shell-like ability to
		simple hit 'return' on an empty line, we have a hack. The console window
		detects empty lines and automatically appends a ";". This "feels better"
		but is a little weird. For example, you can type "a=5" and hit return
		twice to complete the line (the first is just trailing whitespace, the
		second triggers the auto ";"). 
		<br/>
		When you run the bsh.Interpeter on the command line (in interactive
		mode), a simple stream filter takes the place of the console and
		preforms the ";" hack. I rationalize this by thinking that in the future
		this stream filter will do "real" line editing and history. 	
		<br/>
		In the future, I'd like to fix all of this in a clean way and also
		implement some parser feedback so that we can do a proper multi-line
		statement prompt as in other shells.
